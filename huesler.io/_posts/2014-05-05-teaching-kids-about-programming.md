title: "Teaching kids about programming"
---

Earlier these year, I taught a couple of 15 minute lectures to schoold kids on the topic of game programming. The material can be found [here.](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/d8uqxyz50ywx30p/AABewT8YNWfbglwgBI9ceb0ea/GamesForYoungAdults)
One group of kids visited me at the [wooga offices](http://www.wooga.com/jobs/office-tour/) where I prepared a [MakeyMakey](http://www.makeymakey.com) to control a game.

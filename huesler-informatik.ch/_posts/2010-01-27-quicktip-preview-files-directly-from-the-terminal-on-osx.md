title: Quicktip -  Preview files directly from the terminal on OSX
---

<p>This is quick tip week. Have you ever wanted to preview a file on OSX with quick view without leaving the console. Well here is how:
  <pre>qlmanage -p file</pre>
So if you wanted to preview the file <em>image.png</em> you would type:
<pre>qlmanage -p image.png</pre>
If you want to see the thumbnail preview of a file instead, just use <em>-t</em> instead of <em>-p</em>.
To close the window either click the cross on the upper right corner or hit <em>control-c</em> to cancel the process. Happy previewing!

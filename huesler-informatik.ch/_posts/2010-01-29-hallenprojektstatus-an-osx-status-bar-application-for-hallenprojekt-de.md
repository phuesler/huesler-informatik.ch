title: HallenProjektStatus -  An OSX status bar application for hallenprojekt.de
---

<p>I have been writing Ruby applications exclusively for awhile now, so I thought it is time to try out something new. As a result, I have developed an OSX Cocoa application for <a href="http://hallenprojekt.de/" title="Showing places &raquo; hallenprojekt.de | Neue Orte fÃ¼r neues Arbeiten" target="_BLANK">hallenprojekt.de,</a> a website that aggregates different co working spaces. It is an application that lives in the status bar and allows easy checking into the available co working spaces.</p>

<p>It was fun and sometimes painful to learn how to achieve things with Objective-C and Cocoa in particular. And of course, learn how to automate packaging and deployment of new releases including automatic updates. Ironically, I ended up doing most of those tasks with Ruby. I will write a few blog posts covering my endeavors.</p>

<p>The source is available on <a href="http://github.com/phuesler/Hallenprojektstatus" title="phuesler's Hallenprojektstatus at master - GitHub" target="_BLANK">github</a> and the application itself can be downloaded <a href="http://hallenprojekt.huesler-informatik.ch/HallenprojektStatus.dmg" title="" target="_BLANK">here.</a></p>
